For our final project our team looked at storm data gathered by the United States weather service between 2011 and 2015.
Our first step was to investigate the measures using a boxplot. This one was particularly interesting:

The relationship between the size of the storm and the damage it caused really interested us. 
Next, we applied a KPI which measured the intensity of the event (total damage over time elapsed) and compared it to the state in which it occurred.
