For our final project our team looked at storm data gathered by the United States weather service between 2011 and 2015.

Our first step was to investigate the measures using a boxplot. This one was particularly interesting:

The relationship between the size of the storm and the damage it caused really interested us. 

Next, we applied a KPI which measured the intensity of the event (total damage over time elapsed) and used it to examine the distribution of damage.

For our Crosstab we examined the relationship between state, year, and our Damage KPI.
