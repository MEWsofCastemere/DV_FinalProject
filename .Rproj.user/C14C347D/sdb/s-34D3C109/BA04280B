This one was particularly interesting:\n![](./BoxPlot.jpg)\n\nThe relationship between the size of the storm and the damage it caused really interested us. \n\nNext, we applied a KPI which measured the intensity of the event (total damage over time elapsed) and used it to examine the distribution of damage. \n![](./Histogram.jpg)\n\nFor our Crosstab we examined the relationship between state, year, and our Damage KPI.\n\nBefore: The result of plugging in the data\n![](./CrossTabBefore.jpg)\n\nAfter: The result of filtering and adding parameters\n![](./CrossTabAfter.jpg)",
